# About.

Hi, my name is Mister Vue. Thank you for stopping by my classroom website. This site was created for my students and their parents and serves as a communication tool. As the year progresses, this website will be an important resource to keep up with what we are doing in the classroom and to showcase the awesome things happening at our school. 

## A little about me. 

I was born in Thailand and my parents immigrated to the United States when I was about one years old. I've always loved learning and being a part of a learning community, hence why I've decided to become a teacher. My favorite memory of grade school was building a bridge out of toothpicks and dancing.

For the last two and a half years, I worked as the Computer Support Specialist for Natomas Charter School integrating technology into classrooms. My desire to teach was actually born from this position in which I got to witness the amazing things students and teachers were doing with technology. I found myself being drawn to the classroom every opportunity I had and eventually decided that teaching and the classroom was where I truly wanted to be.

In addition to my enthusiasm for technology, I love to cook. I own a food blog where I attempt to make simple and delicious meals. If you are interested in finding your next recipe, looking at delicious food pictures, or just curious, visit my food blog at: http://www.foodstuffblog.com. I try to keep my cooking experiences exciting by trying new and different kinds of food.
